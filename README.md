# Plagiarism Detector

## Overview

This project implements a plagiarism detector in Python. The detector compares a query text against a set of reference texts and identifies similarities using cosine similarity scores. It incorporates text preprocessing, feature extraction (Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF), and similarity calculation techniques.

## Files

1. **feature_extraction.py**: This file contains functions for extracting features from text using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF methods.

2. **preprocess.py**: The preprocessing module provides functions for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stop word removal, punctuation removal, and lemmatization.

3. **similarity_calculation.py**: Implements the calculation of similarity scores between query text and reference texts using cosine similarity.

4. **main.py**: The main script orchestrates the plagiarism detection process. It imports functions from other files to preprocess texts, extract features, calculate similarity scores, and identify plagiarized content.

## Dependencies

- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning tasks including feature extraction and similarity calculation.

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the `main.py` script with your query text and reference texts. Modify the `query_text` and `reference_texts` variables in the script as needed.

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The script will output detected plagiarized content along with their similarity scores, if any.

## Customization

- Adjust the threshold for similarity score in the `detect_plagiarism` function to control the sensitivity of plagiarism detection.
- Modify preprocessing techniques or feature extraction methods according to your requirements.
- Extend functionality by incorporating advanced similarity measures or additional features.
